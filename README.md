## 📜 About This Project (Archived)

**🔒 Secure Realtime Status Dashboard** was a fully browser-based, Firebase-powered status dashboard where:

- 🌐 Anyone could view the current system status
- ✅ Authorized users (via **Google Sign-In**) could log in and **edit the status**
- 🔄 All updates were **live** — status changes were visible instantly to all connected clients
- 🎨 Built with a clean, responsive, full-page interface using **Tailwind CSS**

---

### 🛠️ Purpose

It provided a secure way to share live service/system status updates publicly, while keeping editing restricted to trusted users.

**Original intended uses included:**
- System monitoring dashboards
- Maintenance updates
- Public-facing server status pages
- Roleplay group announcements (e.g., Roblox, Minecraft, etc.)

---

### 🔧 Key Features

- 🔐 Google Sign-In for authentication  
- 🔄 Firebase Realtime Database for synchronized status  
- 🎨 Fully responsive modern UI (mobile + desktop)  
- 💾 No backend or hosting needed — deploy directly to GitHub Pages or Firebase Hosting  
- 📡 Public access: everyone could view status, but only logged-in users could edit it
