# 🔒 Secure Realtime Status Dashboard

This is a fully browser-based, Firebase-powered status dashboard where:

- 🌐 Anyone can view the current system status
- ✅ Authorized users (via **Google Sign-In**) can log in and **edit the status**
- 🔄 All updates are **live** — status changes are visible instantly to all connected clients
- 🎨 Built with a clean, responsive, full-page interface using **Tailwind CSS**

---

## 🛠️ What This Is

This project provides a secure way to share live service/system status updates publicly, while keeping editing restricted to trusted users only.

Ideal for:
- System monitoring dashboards
- Maintenance updates
- Public-facing server status pages
- Roleplay group announcements (e.g., Roblox, Minecraft, etc.)
